# Estimation Data Analysis with Applications

## Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM and ARIMA with Quandl API and Prophet Facebook with CoinMarketCap API

The objective of this project is to predict the future trend of a time-series, in this special case the Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and global payment system created in 2009. The project has been realized in Python with the use of the open source Jupyter Web application on a dataset obtained from the “Quandl” site. In particular we will use mathematical concepts, including some studied in class, to modify this dataset and extract information and graphs. Finally we will also perform a process of remodeling, aggregation, separation and transformation of data from a format to a more useful one to calculate results.
